# Barbot project
This is a work in progress. Will utilize Wemos D1 mini to control stepper motors and peristaltic pumps to create drinks from a pre-defined list of available drinks that is stored in a JSON file. The Wemos D1 mini hosts a server which can be accessed via a web interface to see available drinks order drink, and view your number in line.
